The goal is to predict the class of forest cover (the predominant kind of tree cover) from strictly cartographic and environment variables.

The actual forest cover type for a given observation (30 x 30 meter cell) was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System (RIS) data. Independent variables were derived from data originally obtained from US Geological Survey (USGS) and USFS data. Data is in raw form (not scaled) and contains categorical data for qualitative independent variables (wilderness areas and soil types).
